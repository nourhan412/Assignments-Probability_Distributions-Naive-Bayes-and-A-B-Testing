# Probability-Distributions-Naive-Bayes

This is the first coding assignment from the "Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning & Data Science" course.

In this assignment, I have:
1. Generated data that follows various probability distributions like uniform and normal distribution.
2. Utilized this generated data to develop a Naive Bayes classifier for the continuous case.
3. Developed a Naive Bayes algorithm to compute the probability of an email being spam using a real-life dataset.
