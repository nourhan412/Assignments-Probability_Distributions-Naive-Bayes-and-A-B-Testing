# Probability-Distributions-Naive-Bayes and A/B Testing

This repository contains 2 assignments from the "Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning & Data Science" course.

## Probability Distributions and Naive Bayes

In the Probability Distributions and Naive Bayes assignment, I have:
1. Generated data that follows various probability distributions like uniform and normal distribution.
2. Utilized this generated data to develop a Naive Bayes classifier for the continuous case.
3. Developed a Naive Bayes algorithm to compute the probability of an email being spam using a real-life dataset.

## A/B Testing

In the A/B Testing assignment, I worked with two cases that required computing the relevant statistics for each of them, and make decisions on whether to (or not) reject the null hypothesis.

### Case 1: Continuous Metric - Average Session Duration

I conducted an A/B test to determine whether it encouraged users to extend their visit durations on the website after changing the color palette of the background.

### Case 2: Proportions - Conversion Rate (CVR)

A/B test to determine if a new feature (which provides custom suggestions to each user based on their preferences) will increase the conversion rate of the app.
